2. Description:
	1. Suppose you are developing a Frontend Application that connects with a Backend Application via REST API. In that case, you will often need to create a Backend application and only test your Frontend Application. Developing a Backend application requires effort and time and is often a sunk cost, especially if your focus is only to create a Frontend Application.
	2. JSON Server is a pretty handy project that tackles this issue explicitly. Using JSON Server, you will be able to generate a Zero-Code entirely fake API within 30 seconds. It can give a huge productivity boost for Frontend Developers.
