2. Description:
	1. The “Realworld” GitHub repository is called the “Mother of all demo apps.” While many demo apps offer a quick way to run an application using a particular framework (often todo app), those apps lack the complexity and depth of a real-world scenario. RealWorld solves this by enabling you to develop complex, real-world Full-Stack applications (a clone of Medium) where the Frontend and Backend services communicate via API. It currently supports three Frontend frameworks (Angular 1, Angular 2+, React) and three Backend frameworks (Rails, Django, Node.js).
