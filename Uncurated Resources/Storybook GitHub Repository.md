	1. Component-driven UI development is the mainstream UI development technology in modern times. Building a component-driven UI is not that easy: the Backend, authentication, and authorization must be there. Storybook provides a development environment to develop component-driven UI in isolation. It allows browsing a component library, viewing each componentâ€™s different states, and developing and testing components interactively. Moreover, it offers a way to collaborate among the designers, developers, product owners, and others.
	2. It supports almost all significant component-driven UI development frameworks, including React, Vue, Angular, Web Components, Svelte, Ember, React Native. It also offers support for Mobile App development (iOS, Android, Flutter).
