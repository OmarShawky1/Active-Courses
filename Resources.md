**Note:**
1. Current Curated resources that are #Tested & #Ordered are all in my [CS-Roadmap](https://github.com/OmarShawky1/CS-Roadmap)
2. This file should be written just like [[OSSU]] README design; Courses are under a section and written in a table. The content table shall just include more columns such as "Decision Reasons List" & "Alternatives List" ordered.
